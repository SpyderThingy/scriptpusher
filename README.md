# my scripts!!!!!!!!!!!!
## Installation
check the latest package, or click "Code" and "Download ZIP" if im too lazy (which i usually am :3c)
## How to run
Either run the HTML file on a browser of your choice (as long as it supports JS) or:
### IN EMACS
Make sure you have skewer-mode, simple-httpd & js2-mode installed and enable skewer-mode (or just have spacemacs). Then, do M-x and type run-skewer, and do C-c C-k. It should be running on https://127.0.0.1:8080/skewer.
### IN VSCODE
Install Live Server and Live Preview. Then, on the bottom, click Go live. It may ask for you to select a browser. Select one and it should be running on port 5500.
### WITH NODE.JS
Install browser-sync and run `browser-sync start --server --files .` and it should run in your browser.
